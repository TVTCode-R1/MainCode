# MainCode
This repository contains the core implementation of our hierarchical framework for Connected Automated Vehicles (CAVs). It combines HE-MATD3 (Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning) for efficient homotopy exploration with a Lightweight Iterative OCP solver for precise trajectory refinement in unstructured environments.
