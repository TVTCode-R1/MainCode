Hierarchical Cooperative Trajectory Planning for CAVs
This repository contains the core implementation of our hierarchical framework for Connected Automated Vehicles (CAVs) at unstructured intersections. It combines HE-MATD3 (Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning) for efficient homotopy exploration with a specialized Optimization-based Planner for precise trajectory refinement.
